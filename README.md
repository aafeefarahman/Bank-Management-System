# AU Bank Management System

## Overview

The AU Bank Management System is a GUI-based banking application developed using Python and Tkinter. This system allows users to perform essential banking operations such as account registration, login, balance inquiry, deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and bill payments through an interactive graphical interface.

The system stores customer data securely using JSON file storage, ensuring persistent and reliable data management.

## Features

- Customer Registration and Login
- Secure Authentication System
- Balance Inquiry
- Deposit Money
- Withdraw Money
- Transfer Money between Accounts
- Bill Payment Functionality
- Profile Update Option
- Persistent Data Storage using JSON
- Interactive GUI with images and fullscreen mode

## System Workflow

1. User registers or logs into the system
2. System validates user credentials
3. User accesses dashboard
4. User performs banking operations:
   - Deposit
   - Withdraw
   - Transfer
   - Bill Payment
5. System updates data in JSON file
6. Changes remain saved for future sessions
